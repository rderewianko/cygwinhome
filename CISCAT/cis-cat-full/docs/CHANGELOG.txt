		- CSV Report Option in CIS-CAT Dashboard
		  The CSV report option allows a user to export dashboard results to comma-separated
		  value format, which is then viewable with Excel.
		
		- XCCDF 1.2 Support
		  CIS-CAT has been enhanced to support assessments using version 1.2 of the eXtensible
		  Configuration Checklist Description Format.  XCCDF 1.2 represents the latest version
		  of the specification, and was used in the implementation of both the CIS MIT Kerberos 
		  1.10 benchmark v1.0.0 and the CIS Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 Benchmark v1.0.0.
		  
		- SCAP 1.2 Support (Beta)
		  CIS-CAT conforms to the specifications outlined by the Security Content Automation 
		  Protocol (SCAP), version 1.2, as outlined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-126 rev.2.
		  As part of the SCAP 1.2 protocol, CIS-CAT's assessment capabilities have been expanded
		  to include the consumption of source data stream collection XML files, and the generation
		  of well-formed SCAP result data streams.
		  
		  SCAP 1.2 support increases a CIS-CAT user's ability to consume standards-based configuration
		  content from CIS or any other standards-compliant provider. Additionally, SCAP 1.2 allows 
		  CIS-CAT users to incorporate CIS-CAT assessment results into any standards-based product.
		  
		  As is required by the SCAP 1.2 specifications, CIS-CAT implements/adheres to the following
		  language/enumeration standards:
		  	- The eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) version 1.2, 
		  	- The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) version 5.10, 
		  	- Asset Identification version 1.1, 
		  	- Asset Reporting Format version 1.1, 
		  	- The Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) version 5, 
		  	- The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) versions 2.2 and 2.3.
		  
		  To exercise this capability, users may download the "SCAP 1.2 Content...using OVAL version 5.10"
		  resources from the NIST NVD National Checklist Program repository for the following Operating
		  Systems:
		  	- Microsoft Windows 7
		  	- Microsoft Windows XP
		  	- Microsoft Windows Vista
		  	- Microsoft Internet Explorer 7
		  	- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8
		  
		  Please refer to the CIS-CAT User's Guide for more information on executing assessments against
		  SCAP 1.2 compliant data stream collections.
		  
		  NOTE: Please note that SCAP 1.2 data stream collection assessments are currently in a Beta phase, 
		        and CIS welcomes any feedback our members would be willing to provide.
