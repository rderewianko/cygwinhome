   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

                        minimum length for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) startup PIN. This policy
                        setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The startup PIN must have a
                        minimum length of 4 digits and can have a maximum length of 20 digits. If
                        you enable this policy setting, you can require a minimum number of digits
                        to be used when setting the startup PIN. If you disable or do not configure
                        this policy setting, users can configure a startup PIN of any length between
                        4 and 20 digits.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">BitLocker requires the use of the function keys
                        [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment
                        before locationalization support is available. This limits each PIN digit to
                        one of ten possibilities. The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that
                        includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry
                        attempts; however, using a PIN that is short in length improves an
                        attacker's chances of guessing the correct PIN.</rationale>

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting allows you to configure whether
                        BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts
                        and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform
                        Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
                        Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at
                        startup, otherwise a policy error occurs. If you want to use BitLocker on a
                        computer without a TPM, select the Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM
                        check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key
                        information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a
                        USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is
                        authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or
                        unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to
                        access the drive. On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of
                        authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection
                        for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for
                        authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive
                        containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal
                        identification number (PIN), or both. If you enable this policy setting,
                        users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.
                        If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can configure
                        only basic options on computers with a TPM. Note: If you want to require the
                        use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker
                        settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker
                        Drive Encryption setup wizard.</description>

                        that is alpha-numeric. When not using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker
                        requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN
                        is entered in the pre-OS environment before locationalization support is
                        available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM
                        has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially
                        increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to
                        more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of
                        the function keys.</rationale>

                        the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when
                        you turn on BitLocker. The Allow certificate-based data recovery agent check
                        box is used to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with
                        BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent
                        can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the
                        Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult
                        the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for
                        more information about adding data recovery agents. In Configure user
                        storage of BitLocker recovery information select whether users are allowed,
                        required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a
                        256-bit recovery key. Select Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup
                        wizard to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable
                        BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                        recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery
                        options for the drive are determined by the policy setting. In Save
                        BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services, choose
                        which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system
                        drives. If you select Backup recovery password and key package, both the
                        BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the
                        key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically
                        corrupted. If you select Backup recovery password only, only the recovery
                        password is stored in AD DS. Select the Do not enable BitLocker until
                        recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives check
                        box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer
                        is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information
                        to AD DS succeeds. Note: If the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery
                        information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives check box is
                        selected, a recovery password is automatically generated. If you enable this
                        policy setting, you can control the methods available to users to recover
                        data from BitLocker-protected operating system drives. If this policy
                        setting is disabled or not configured, the default recovery options are
                        supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA is allowed, the recovery
                        options can be specified by the user including the recovery password and
                        recovery key, and recovery information is not backed up to AD

                        enforce complexity requirements on the password, and configure a minimum
                        length for the password. For the complexity requirement setting to be

                        volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors
                        available on the drive. If you enable this policy setting, users can
                        configure a password that meets the requirements you define. To require the
                        use of a password, select Require password for fixed data drive. To enforce

                        of actual password complexity and the drive will be encrypted using that
                        password as a protector. When set to Do not allow complexity, no password
                        complexity validation will be done. Passwords must be at least 8 characters.
                        To configure a greater minimum length for the password, enter the desired
                        number of characters in the Minimum password length box. If you disable this
                        policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password. If you do not
                        configure this policy setting, passwords will be supported with the default
                        settings, which do not include password complexity requirements and require
                        only 8 characters. Note: Passwords cannot be used if FIPS-compliance is

                        options from the BitLocker setup wizard to prevent users from specifying
                        recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you
                        will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable
                        BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined
                        by the policy setting. In Save BitLocker recovery information to Active

                        store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select Backup recovery password

                        stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a
                        drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select Backup recovery
                        password only, only the recovery password is stored in AD DS. Select the Do

                        the protectors available on the drive. If you enable this policy setting,
                        users can configure a password that meets the requirements that you define.
                        To require the use of a password, select Require password for removable data
                        drive. To enforce complexity requirements on the password, select Require
                        complexity. When set to Require complexity a connection to a domain
                        controller is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity
                        the password. When set to Allow complexity a connection to a domain
                        controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the rules
                        set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the password will
                        still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity and the drive
                        will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When set to Do not
                        allow complexity, no password complexity validation will be done. Passwords
                        must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater minimum length for the
                        password, enter the desired number of characters in the Minimum password
                        length box. If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to
                        use a password. If you do not configure this policy setting, passwords will
                        be supported with the default settings, which do not include password
                        complexity requirements and require only 8 characters. Note: Passwords

                        the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on
                        BitLocker. The Allow data recovery agent check box is used to specify
                        whether a data recovery agent can be used with BitLocker-protected removable
                        data drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used it must be added from
                        the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console
                        or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption
                        Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding data
                        recovery agents. In Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information
                        select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a
                        48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key. Select Omit recovery
                        options from the BitLocker setup wizard to prevent users from specifying
                        recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you
                        will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable
                        BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined
                        by the policy setting. In Save BitLocker recovery information to Active
                        Directory Domain Services choose which BitLocker recovery information to
                        store in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select Backup recovery
                        password and key package, both the BitLocker recovery password and key
                        package are stored in AD DS. If you select Backup recovery password only
                        only the recovery password is stored in AD DS. Select the Do not enable
                        BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data
                        drives check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless
                        the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery
                        information to AD DS succeeds. Note: If the Do not enable BitLocker until
                        recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives check box is
                        selected, a recovery password is automatically generated. If you enable this
                        policy setting, you can control the methods available to users to recover
                        data from BitLocker-protected removable data drives. If this policy setting
                        is not configured or disabled, the default recovery options are supported
                        for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA is allowed, the recovery options
                        can be specified by the user including the recovery password and recovery
                        key, and recovery information is not backed up to AD DS.</description>

                           <p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information
                              unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence
                              of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
                              logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because
                              they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any
                              evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you
                              automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all
                              specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses
                              Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other automated monitoring
                              tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an
                              attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the
                              Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you
                              will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's
                              activities.</p>

                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence
                              of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
                              logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because
                              they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any
                              evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you
                              automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all
                              specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses
                              Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other automated monitoring
                              tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an
                              attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the
                              Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you
                              will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's

                           Mailto standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet
                           link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to

                        client will attempt to negotiate SMB packet signing. The implementation of
                        digital signing in Windowsbased networks helps to prevent sessions from
                        being hijacked. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network
                        client will use signing only if the server with which it communicates
                        accepts digitally signed communication. Microsoft recommends to enable The
                        Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)
                        setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network
                        makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who
                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so
                        that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the
                        attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication
                        and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol
                        that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of
                        NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and
                        the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication
                        process, data transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server
                              2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the
                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
                              which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message
                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers
                              running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy

                        SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication

                        Server 2003, the connection will fail if encryption is not negotiated.

                        negotiated. The integrity of a message can be assessed through message
                        signing. Message signing proves that the message has not been tampered with;
                        it attaches a cryptographic signature that identifies the sender and is a
                        numeric representation of the contents of the message. . Require 128-bit
                        encryption. The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) is not
                        negotiated. . Require NTLMv2 session security. The connection will fail if

                        challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for
                        local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in
                        Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to
                        protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is
                        that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues,
                        which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks thattempt to guess
                        passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and
                        there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID
                        rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename
                        the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by
                        using the SID to log on.</rationale>

                        introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious
                        software running under elevated credentials without the user or
                        administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these
                        programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator"
                        because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To
                        address this risk, in Windows Vista the built-in Administrator account is
                        disabled. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with
                        administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two
                        ways: . If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account
                        you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. . If the
                        computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created.
                        The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and
                        create one if a local administrator account is warranted. Once Windows Vista
                        is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be enabled, but we
                        strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.</rationale>

                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
                              which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message
                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on
                              domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers
                              running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy

                              SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,

                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each

                              Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on

                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so
                        that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the
                        attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication
                        and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol
                        that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of
                        NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and
                        the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication
                        process, data transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                              through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators
                              Kit. Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows
                              XP SP2 that try to connect to a Terminal Services server that has this
                              setting enabled will be unable to communicate with the server until an

                        policy filters are documented in the online help for the specific operating
                        system. These filters make it possible for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and
                        the Kerberos authentication protocol to function. The filters also make it
                        possible for the network Quality of Service (QoS) to be signaled (RSVP) when
                        the data traffic is secured by IPsec, and for traffic that IPsec might not
                        secure such as multicast and broadcast traffic. IPsec is increasingly used
                        for basic host-firewall packet filtering, particularly in Internet-exposed

                        attacks that use the default exemptions. For additional information, see the

                        extension to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous
                        versions of Windows, Negotiate decides whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for
                        authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts, which is treated
                        as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including
                        PKU2U. You can also develop or add other SSPs. When computers are configured
                        to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls
                        the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains
                        a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.
                        When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is
                        sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate
                        to a security token and the logon process completes. This policy will be
                        turned off by default on domain joined machines. This would disallow the
                        online identities to be able to authenticate to the domain joined machine in
                        Windows 7.</description>

                              where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials
                              as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT
                              4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows
                              operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
                              channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless
                              they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the

                              The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients
                              running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will

                              than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to
                              authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a
                              version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted
                              domain will be disabled. You can enable this policy setting after you
                              eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and upgrade all

                              as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT
                              4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows

                     <description xml:lang="en">LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft
                        client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together
                        on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print
                        sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active
                        Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication
                        protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some
                        reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager
                        authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants,
                        and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when
                        they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate
                        between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains .
                        Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
                        or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
                        possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level
                        setting are: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses . Send LM &amp; NTLM — use
                        NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send
                        NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2
                        responses only\refuse LM &amp; NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN
                        Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response
                        authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the
                        authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level
                        that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers
                        accept as follows: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
                        authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM &amp; NTLM use NTLMv2
                        session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and
                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only.
                        Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2

                        it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send

                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers

                        follows: . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session
                        security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never use NTLMv2

                        authentication. . Level 1 Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients
                        use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM
                        authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it.
                        Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3
                        Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2
                        session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM,
                        NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM
                        responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security
                        if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that
                        is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and
                        NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use
                        and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2).</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However,
                        in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured
                        by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based
                        and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers
                        allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
                        However, this means that LM responses—the weakest form of authentication
                        response—are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
                        attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's
                        password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems
                        cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this
                        reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by
                        default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You
                        can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows
                        98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
                        secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2
                        for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
                        members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
                        authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</rationale>

                        this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used
                        when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the

                        certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system
                        is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by
                        halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system
                        experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will
                        be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the

                        is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. Therefore, this policy

                              significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for

                              configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could
                              deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of
                              service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut
                              down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events
                              that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is
                              not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating

                        system components will need it. Note Microsoft released several security
                        updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the
                        administrator to have the Debug programs user right. Administrators who did
                        not have this user right were unable to install these security updates until
                        they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical behavior for
                        operating system updates. For more information, see Knowledge Base article
                        830846: Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may use most or all

                              However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on
                              production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application
                              to be debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a
                              different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a
                              separate Group Policy for that OU. The service account that is used
                              for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege; if it does
                              not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. For additional information
                              about how to configure Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer

                              owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows
                              Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for
                              administrators to terminate processes that they did not start. Also,
                              some older versions of Update.exe (which is used to install Windows
                              product updates) require the account that applies the update to have
                              this user right. If you install one of the patches that uses this
                              version of Update.exe, the computer could become unresponsive. For

                        appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged

                        cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it
                        impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to
                        access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur
                        when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                        as the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any read or write
                        permissions to the user. The only scenario in which the default
                        configuration could lead to a mishap would be if the administrator who
                        configures permissions does not understand how this policy setting works.
                        For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to
                        access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders.
                        Such a situation is unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents
                        little risk.</rationale>

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users can
                        create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects,
                        such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of
                        file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer
                        (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can
                        be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between
                        a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the
                        Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just
                        another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is
                        implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can
                        potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
                        designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic
                        links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
                        Administrators can create symbolic links. When configuring a user right in
                        the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either
                        local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or

                     <description xml:lang="en">The policy setting allows programs that run on
                        behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so
                        that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for
                        this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to
                        convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or
                        named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client,
                        which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or
                        system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have
                        the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM
                        servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run
                        under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access
                        tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they
                        are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the
                        following conditions exist: . The access token that is being impersonated is
                        for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network
                        with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level
                        is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with
                        the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
                        service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then
                        impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of
                        the client. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited
                        list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active
                        Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.</description>

                              was upgraded from Windows 2000 this account is a member of the Guests
                              group. Therefore, it is important that you understand which accounts

                           Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory
                           include: 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity
                           check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or
                           that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that
                           the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received
                           by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
                           problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound
                           packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could
                           indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low
                           a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963: IPsec dropped an
                           inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually
                           due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing
                           this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965: IPsec
                           received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
                           Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware
                           that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the
                           packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by
                           this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems
                           with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not
                           impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478: IPsec Services has
                           started successfully. 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down
                           successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at
                           greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential
                           security risks. 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of
                           network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk
                           because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                           provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
                           snap-in to diagnose the problem. 5483: IPsec Services failed to
                           initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. 5484: IPsec
                           Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The
                           shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of
                           network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485:
                           IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play
                           event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk
                           because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                           provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor

                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           file share object that has a specified system access control list (SACL),
                           effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised of
                           access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 5140: A network share object was accessed. Refer to

                        <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports when file system objects
                           are accessed. Only file system objects with SACLs cause audit events to
                           be generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their
                           SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           file system object that has a specified system access control list
                           (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised
                           of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 4664: An attempt was made to create a hard link.
                           4985: The state of a transaction has changed. 5051: A file was
                           virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article Description of

                           are accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be
                           generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their
                           SACL. By itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any
                           events. It determines whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a
                           registry object that has a specified system access control list (SACL),
                           effectively enabling auditing to take place. A SACL is comprised of
                           access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces of
                           information: . The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be
                           audited. . The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.
                           . A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful
                           access events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting
                           to Success, an audit entry is generated each time that a user
                           successfully accesses an object with a specified SACL. If you configure
                           this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated each time
                           that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                           SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when
                           they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and
                           Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                           changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
                           typically target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track
                           when sensitive documents are accessed or changed. Events for this
                           subcategory include: 4657 : A registry value was modified. 5039: A

                           Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). The types of changes that are
                           reported are create, modify, move, and undelete operations that are
                           performed on an object. DS Change auditing, where appropriate, indicates
                           the old and new values of the changed properties of the objects that were
                           changed. Only objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and
                           only when they are accessed in a manner that matches their SACL. Some
                           objects and properties do not cause audit events to be generated due to
                           settings on the object class in the schema. This subcategory applies only
                           to domain controllers. Events for this subcategory include: 5136 : A
                           directory service object was modified. 5137 : A directory service object
                           was created. 5138 : A directory service object was undeleted. 5139 : A

                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The
                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                              default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall
                              rules that block the connection. Important If you set Outbound
                              connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a
                              GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent
                              Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule
                              that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                              Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work.
                              Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test
                              firewall profiles before deploying.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block

                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                              outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. In
                              Windows Vista, the default behavior is to allow connections unless
                              there are firewall rules that block the connection.</description>
                           <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block
                              all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the
                              user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking
                              outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large
                              number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block
                              applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.
                              Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an
                              attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
                              anyway.</rationale>

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting determines the
                           number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users
                           can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
                           remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer
                           while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect
                           password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the
                           password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid
                           accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold
                           to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                           logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature.<br/>Because
                           it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of
                           service (DoS) by triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your
                           organization should determine whether to use this policy setting based on
                           identified threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two
                           options to consider for this policy setting.<br/>. Configure the value
                           for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be
                           locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack thattempts to
                           lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk
                           calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their
                           accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a
                           brute force attack. The following defenses should also be
                           considered:<br/>. A password policy that forces all users to have complex
                           passwords made up of 8 or more characters.<br/>. A robust auditing
                           mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account
                           lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution
                           should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This
                           event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the
                           logon attempt.<br/>The second option is:<br/>. Configure the value for
                           Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability
                           to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a
                           brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent
                           accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                           prevent a DoS attack.</p>

                           methods to try millions of password combinations for any user account.
                           The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit
                           the number of failed logons that can be performed.<br/>However, a DoS
                           attack could be performed on a domain that has an account lockout
                           threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series
                           of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number
                           of attempts is greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker

                        10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to
                        remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance
                        of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise

                        ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
                        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: .
                        Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that
                        exceed two consecutive characters . Be at least six characters in length .
                        Contain characters from three of the following four categories: . English
                        uppercase characters (A through Z) . English lowercase characters (a through
                        z) . Base 10 digits (0 through 9) . Non-alphabetic characters (for example,
                        !, $, #, %) . A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not
                        fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be
                        regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its
                        complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case
                        alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion)
                        possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of
                        many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack.
                        A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527
                        combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without
                        punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2
                        x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large
                        number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try
                        all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase
                        for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters
                        such as ! or @. Proper use of the password settings can help make it

                              characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and
                              press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter
                              might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed
                              password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also,
                              the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the
                              complexity of a password. However, such stringent password
                              requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help
                              desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement
                              for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159
                              range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
                              alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to
                              the password.)</p>

                  <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting allows you to manage whether users
                     can manually remove the zone information from saved file attachments.
                     Typically, users can either click the Unblock button in the file's Property
                     sheet or select a check box in the Security Warning dialog. If the zone
                     information is removed, users can open potentially dangerous file attachments
                     that Windows has prevented users from opening. When the Hide mechanisms to

                     Unblock button. When this policy setting is disabled, Windows displays the
                     check box and the Unblock button. Because dangerous attachments are often
                     downloaded from untrusted Internet Explorer zones such as the Internet zone, it
                     is recommended that you configure this policy setting to Enabled to help ensure
